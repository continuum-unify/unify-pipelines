### **Broad Overview of Your Application**

This application is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, designed to assist users with research by retrieving relevant academic sources and generating AI-driven responses. The system combines document retrieval, context formatting, and AI-powered language models to provide detailed answers to user queries, along with supporting references.

---

### **Structure**

The application is organized into distinct modules under the `src` directory, with each module handling specific responsibilities. Here's a breakdown:

#### **1. `src/config`**
This module manages application configurations, consolidating environment variables, YAML files, and runtime settings.

- **`config.py`**:
  - Loads and validates settings from `config.yaml` and environment variables.
  - Defines paths, API endpoints, and database configurations.
  - Ensures directories exist and handles missing configurations gracefully.

- **`config.yaml`**:
  - The primary configuration file for defining parameters such as:
    - Milvus database connection details.
    - Paths for raw PDFs, embeddings, and processed data.
    - Model and embedding service URLs.

---

#### **2. `src/logs`**
Handles logging utilities to ensure consistent, structured logs throughout the application.

- **`logger.py`**:
  - Provides a logger setup to standardize log formatting and levels (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`).
  - Enables debugging and tracking for key operations like model interaction and retrieval.

---

#### **3. `src/embedding.py`**
Facilitates interaction with an embedding generation service (e.g., NVIDIA NeMo).

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Generates embeddings for queries and documents to enable vector similarity search.
  - Handles retries and timeouts for embedding API requests.

---

#### **4. `src/milvus_client.py`**
Manages all interactions with the Milvus vector database.

- **Key Features**:
  - Establishes connections to Milvus.
  - Defines schemas for collections and manages vector indexes.
  - Handles collection creation, loading, and querying.
  - Supports releasing and dropping collections to manage memory and storage.

---

#### **5. `src/milvus_search.py`**
(Not detailed in the files above but likely a utility script.)
- Performs advanced search operations in Milvus.
- Likely wraps Milvus querying and result handling, optimizing retrieval performance.

---

#### **6. `src/model.py`**
Provides an interface for interacting with the language model API.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Sends prompts to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT or NVIDIA NeMo models).
  - Includes retry logic and error handling for robust communication.
  - Supports customizable generation parameters (e.g., `max_tokens`, `temperature`).

---

#### **7. `src/rag`**
This is the core module of the application, implementing the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.

- **Submodules**:
  - **`engine.py`**:
    - Orchestrates the RAG pipeline.
    - Combines retrieval (via `retriever.py`), context formatting (via `formatter.py`), and response generation (via `model.py`).
    - Tracks performance metrics for both retrieval and model inference.

  - **`retriever.py`**:
    - Implements document retrieval using Milvus and other potential retrieval methods (e.g., BM25 or hybrid approaches).
    - Converts search results into structured objects for downstream processing.

  - **`formatter.py`**:
    - Formats retrieved documents into a context suitable for LLM input.
    - Ensures the generated prompt aligns with the LLMâ€™s expected structure.

  - **`schemas.py`**:
    - Defines data structures like `ArxivSource`, `SearchMetrics`, and `ModelMetrics`.
    - Facilitates structured handling of sources and performance metrics.

---

#### **8. `transform.py`**
A utility script for data processing and transformation.

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Likely handles pre- and post-processing tasks, such as:
    - Converting raw data (e.g., PDFs or JSON) into structured formats for embedding.
    - Processing outputs from the RAG engine for user display or export.

---

### **High-Level Workflow**

1. **Configuration**:
   - The application initializes settings via `src/config/config.py`, loading all necessary parameters for Milvus, the embedding service, and the LLM API.

2. **User Query**:
   - A question is provided by the user via a CLI (or another interface).

3. **Retrieval**:
   - The query is embedded using `src/embedding.py`.
   - A vector search is performed in Milvus using `src/milvus_client.py` and `src/rag/retriever.py`.
   - Results are wrapped in structured objects (`ArxivSource`) using `schemas.py`.

4. **Context Formatting**:
   - The retrieved documents are processed into a context by `src/rag/formatter.py`.

5. **Response Generation**:
   - The context and user query are sent to the LLM via `src/model.py`.
   - A response is generated, incorporating both the query and retrieved sources.

6. **Result Display**:
   - The results are displayed to the user, including:
     - Generated response.
     - Source metadata (e.g., titles, URLs, relevance scores).
     - Performance metrics for each phase.

7. **Export**:
   - Responses and metadata can be exported for offline use or further analysis.

### **Design Highlights**

- **Modularity**:
  - Each module has a focused responsibility, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.
  
- **Rich CLI**:
  - Utilizes the `rich` library to provide an interactive, user-friendly command-line interface.

- **Robust Error Handling**:
  - Implements retry logic and detailed error logging in critical modules like `model.py` and `milvus_client.py`.

- **Performance Tracking**:
  - Tracks metrics for each stage of the pipeline, aiding in performance monitoring and optimization.
